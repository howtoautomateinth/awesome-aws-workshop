# CloudFormation

AWS Services for provision AWS and third party application resources in your cloud environment

## Steps
- Create a seperate user for working with CFC
- Add policy for user to access services
- Add ROLE for CloudFormation to able to provision AWS resources

***best practise - do not use ROOT user, seperate user and policy only***
